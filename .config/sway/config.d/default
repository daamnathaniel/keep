# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.

### Floating modifier

# Drag floating windows by holding down $mod and left mouse button.
# Resize them with right mouse button + $mod.
# Despite the name, also works for non-floating windows.
# Change normal to inverse to use left mouse button for resizing and right
# mouse button for dragging.
